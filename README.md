# UpperCase

A toy programming language made entirely of upper-case letters and nothing else. No whitespace. No punctuation. No special characters. Just upper-case letters.

Here's an example of the "Hello World" code in uppercase program:

	DSLUHLLELLLLLLLLOWSLUWLLOLLRLLLLLDESP

Yes, it's that bad.

## Usage

UpperCase uses a tree of commands, each command is mapped to a particular sequence of characters.
